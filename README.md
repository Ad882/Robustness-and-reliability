# robustness-and-reliability

Simple math project about how designing robust and reliable paper helicopters.

The aim of the project was to build a paper helicopter based on a A4 sheet of paper that takes the longest to fall to the ground from a given height and quantify uncertainties associated with the falling time.

The Python file was used to find the design of the optimal helicopter (the helicopter having the longest falling time) and the Matlab file was used to quantify the uncertainties.
